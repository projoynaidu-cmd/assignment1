## 🙏 Acknowledgment

This project was submitted as part of my **Front-End Development Assessment**.  
Thank you to **Sir** for the guidance and valuable feedback.

## 📌 Note

Initially, I missed committing the code in smaller steps during structure building, but I organized all major changes and followed a clear Git workflow afterward. I now understand the importance of versioning and meaningful commits, and I’ll follow this practice strictly in future projects.
